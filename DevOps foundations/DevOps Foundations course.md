1. CAMS model
	* Culture
		* Mutual understanding 
		*  Different work ways
		* Paradigms
	* Automation
		* You don't have to invert all your time in this point
		* Create and control your systems
		* Accelerator to help you unlock other DevOps benefits
	* Measurement
		* What is happening?
		* Did changes improve things? (Key measurements).
	* Sharing
		* Documentation
		* Pair programming
		* Reviews
		* Mentoring
2. The three ways
	1. Systems thinking and the principles of flow.
		* Do not try to optimize a part but at the end it costs more time in a big view.
		* Focus on the overall outcome 
		* Understand the whole system to optimize it
	2.  Amplifying feedback loops. 
		* Feedback loop is a process that takes its own output into consideration when deciding what to do next

3. DevOps playbook
	* Culture
		* Safe environment
		* Communication
		* Collaboration
		* Change mindset how people work
	* Process 
		* Learn, share, experiment
	* Infrastructure as code 
		* Use cloud, containers to create software
	* Continuous delivery
		* Automation to implement lean principles, 
		* Test and deploy software with small changes
	* Site reliability
		* Apply engineering to achieve reliability in the application
4. Tools
	*People over process over tools* - Alex Honors

	* Who is responsible for a job function, skills and support. Then...
	* Define the process that needs to happen. Then...
	* Select and implement the tools to achieve the process.
	* Choose criteria
		* How does the tool make everyone collaborate together?
		* KISS -> Keep it simple, stupid
		* DevOps toolchain
		* Adapt to change
5. Break down team barriers (wall of confusion)
	* Cross functional teams
	* Alignment goals
